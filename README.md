# LLM-application-evaluation-LLM-engineer-to-write-an-educational-article-for-peers
We create free, advanced educational content for venture-backed technology startups in the public cloud, IT infrastructure, and AI space. The readers of our content include administrators, engineers, and technical managers learning to master key industry technologies.

To produce content superior to the usual online material, we rely on subject matter experts like you who are willing to share their knowledge with less experienced peers to lend a genuine and practical voice to our educational articles.

Our primary interest is your knowledge, ideas, technical expertise, and your ability to communicate them to readers in the way a mentor might train a new team member. We work with professional editors and graphic designers, so we don’t need perfect English or drawing skills, but we require deep subject matter expertise and the ability to articulate your ideas clearly in grammatically correct sentences.

The articles below are examples of the type of content we create:
- https://nexla.com/enterprise-ai/low-rank-adaptation-of-large-language-models/
- https://www.askwisdom.ai/ai-for-business-intelligence/text-to-sql

In this job posting, we are looking for an expert on AI application evaluation to write an article of 1,500-2,000 words on related technical topics. Examples of specific topics in the series we are producing include the following:

- AI assistant application evaluation
- OWASP risks associated with AI-native workflows
- Security risks like prompt injection and data leakage
- LLM application alignment to topics, brand, toxicity, and tone of voice
- System performance evaluation for hallucinations, context relevance, and answer relevance.

We require candidates to have hands-on experience developing and evaluating AI assistants and workflows, such as RAG systems and agents.
- We are prepared to pay a bonus on this assignment for the right candidate to take the time to learn about our client's technology.

This posting is for a single article. However, if this engagement is successful, we would prefer to collaborate with you on additional articles in the coming months at the rate of one or two articles per month.

Note that all of our educational articles are published anonymously on our clients' websites and are not attributed to any authors.

We require all writing to be original and done by the author, WITHOUT help from generative AI tools such as ChatGPT. Before applying, please read our AI policy at this link: https://bit.ly/4fiy83D.

You will be asked to answer the following questions when submitting a proposal:

- Please explain in a couple of sentences the extent of your hands-on experience working on generative AI application development and evaluation.
- Please provide any writing samples (such as published blogs or content written for internal purposes).

It looks like you're looking for an expert in AI application evaluation, particularly focused on AI assistants and workflows. Since this task involves providing clear and practical advice to technical readers, it's important to focus on your deep knowledge of AI applications and your ability to articulate complex ideas in an accessible way.

Here’s how I would approach answering the questions posed for the proposal:
Answer to the Questions:

    Please explain in a couple of sentences the extent of your hands-on experience working on generative AI application development and evaluation.

    I have hands-on experience developing and evaluating various generative AI applications, including large language model (LLM) based systems like conversational agents and retrieval-augmented generation (RAG) systems. I’ve worked on designing and deploying AI assistants, evaluating their effectiveness in real-world use cases, and addressing key issues such as prompt injection, hallucinations, and relevance of generated responses. This includes assessing the performance of LLMs based on system outputs, prompt optimization, and context-aware response evaluation.

    Please provide any writing samples (such as published blogs or content written for internal purposes).

    While I write for technical audiences regularly, my writing is typically done under strict non-attribution policies, and my work is published anonymously on clients’ platforms. However, I can share relevant writing samples from internal content or blog-style articles that focus on AI evaluation, AI assistant development, and the security risks associated with AI implementations, particularly in enterprise environments. These articles cover topics such as system performance, security best practices in AI, and practical tips for evaluating LLM-based applications, especially in sensitive and critical use cases.

This response emphasizes hands-on experience with LLM-based systems and application evaluation, directly aligning with the article topics you're looking to cover. It also highlights a willingness to engage in further content creation and contribute valuable insights on the technical side.

If you'd like, I can also help you structure the article outline or brainstorm specific subsections within the suggested topics to ensure your writing stays on point and is both informative and engaging. Let me know if you'd like assistance with that!
